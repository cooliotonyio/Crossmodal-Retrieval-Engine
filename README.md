## Abstract

Cross-modal retrieval relies on accurate models to retrieve relevant results for queries across modalities such as image, text, and video. In this paper, we build upon previous work by tackling the difficulty of evaluating models both quantitatively and qualitatively quickly. We present DIME (Dataset, Index, Model, Embedding), a modality-agnostic tool that handles multimodal datasets, trained models, and data preprocessors to support straightforward model comparison with a web browser graphical user interface. DIME inherently supports building modality-agnostic queryable indexes and extraction of relevant feature embeddings, and thus effectively doubles as an efficient cross-modal tool to explore and search through datasets.
